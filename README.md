# Treehouse fsjs-techdegree
![](art/banner.png?raw=true)

This is [the curriculum](Treehouse-FSJS-Curriculum.pdf) for the Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

The Techdegree curriculum is structured into units that each teach a core concept, skill,
language component or framework. You'll learn by watching videos; reinforce your learning
with quizzes and interactive code challenges; apply what you've learned in mini-practice
sessions, and finally, apply all that you've learned in a challenging project that's individually
graded with personalized feedback.

When you've completed the 10 projects in this Techdegree, and passed the final exam, you'll
receive a certificate of accomplishment from Treehouse, and have strong skills to help you
land an entry-level job as a Full Stack Developer.
